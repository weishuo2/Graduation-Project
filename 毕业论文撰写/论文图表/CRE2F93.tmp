\begin{abstract}
Graph coloring is a task of partitioning the nodes in a graph in such a way that two adjacent nodes reside in two different partitions while the number of total partitions is minimized. All the nodes in the same partition are regarded as having the same color. Graph coloring has been widely used in several applications including air traffic management, parallel computing resource allocation and scheduling, community detection. However, there still exist the great challenges in coloring a large-scale graph on GPU. 
%First, the sequential spread algorithm need to visit the color array several times because of color conflict, while the recursion algorithm will lead to the long tail problem. Second, atomic operation is widely used on GPU to maintain the color list, which can greatly reduce the GPU threads efficiency. Third, since GPU memory is limited, coloring large scale graphs on GPU is very challenging.
First, the long-tail problem exists in the recursion algorithm because the conflicting (i.e., different threads assign the adjacent nodes to the same color) becomes more likely to occur as the number of iterations increases. Second, it is hard to parallelize the sequential spread algorithm because in the coloring procedure the coloring behaviour in the current iteration is dependent on the coloring results of the previous iteration. Third, the atomic operation is widely used on GPU to maintain the color list, which can greatly reduce the efficiency of GPU threads.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage high-performance graph coloring algorithm, called \textbf{Feluca}, aiming to address the above challenges.
Feluca combines the recursion-based method with the sequential spread-based method. In the first stage, Feluca use a recursive routine to color the majority of vertices of the graph. Then, it switches to sequential spread method to color the remaining vertices to avoid the conflicts of the recursive algorithm.
Moreover, the following techniques are proposed to further improve the graph coloring performance. i) A new method is proposed to eliminate the cycles in the graph; ii) a top-down scheme is developed to avoid the atomic operation originally required for color selection; and iii) a novel coloring  paradigm is designed to improve the degree of parallelism for the sequential spread part. All these newly developed techniques, together with further GPU-specific optimizations such as coalesced memory access and workload balancing, comprise an efficient parallel graph coloring solution in Feluca. We have conducted extensive experiments on NVIDIA K20m GPU. The results show that Feluca can achieve 4--12X speedup over the greedy coloring algorithm and 3.03--64.42X speedup over the existing Jones-Plassman-Luby (JPL) coloring algorithm.
